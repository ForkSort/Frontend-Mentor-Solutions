## Overview

I used grid to position the elements inside the <main>, and flexbox for the "price" and "timeleft" elements. I tried using list-style-image as bullet for li-elemenets, but css doesn't allow to change their position (see why here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708833/adjust-list-style-image-position), the solution was to use background-images instead of li-bullets.
